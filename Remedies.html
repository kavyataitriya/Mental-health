                    Diagnosing a mental health disorder involves multiple steps.
                     A doctor begins by reviewing the patient's medical history and 
                     conducting a thorough physical exam to rule out physical conditions. 
                     They may also order laboratory tests and imaging exams to screen for underlying causes.
                      Additionally, a psychological evaluation is conducted, including discussing symptoms and 
                      experiences. Mental health questionnaires may be used to assess thoughts, feelings, and 
                      behavior patterns. Diagnosis often follows the criteria outlined in the American Psychiatric
                       Association's DSM-5-TR.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                    Various methods are available to help manage mental health conditions. Treatment is highly individual, and what works
                     for one person may not work for another.
                    Some strategies or treatments are more successful in combination with others. A person with a mental health
                     disorder may choose different options at various stages in their life.
                    It is important for an individual to work closely with a doctor who can help them identify their needs and 
                    provide suitable treatment.
                    Below are some treatment options for people with mental health conditions.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Therapy plays a crucial role in addressing mental health conditions, offering various psychological approaches
                 tailored to individuals' needs. Among these, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) stands out as a widely used method. 
                 CBT focuses on identifying and modifying negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to mental health issues.
                  By challenging distorted beliefs and implementing healthier coping strategies, individuals can learn to manage their
                   symptoms more effectively.
                Exposure therapy is another significant psychological approach used in treating conditions such as phobias, PTSD, and 
                obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).  Through repeated exposure, individuals can learn to confront and
                  overcome their fears, leading to reduced anxiety and improved overall functioning. These therapies, along with others 
                  like dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), provide valuable tools and strategies for individuals to better understand and 
                  cope with their mental health challenges, fostering resilience and promoting recovery. Working closely with healthcare
                   professionals, individuals can gain insight into their conditions, develop effective coping mechanisms, and enhance 
                   their quality of life.

         Some peopleTrusted Source take prescribed medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and drugs for anxiety.
         Although these medications cannot cure mental health disorders, some can help improve symptoms. They may also help a person
        to manage their social interactions and routines.
        Some medications boost the body's absorption of feel-good chemicals, such as serotonin, from the brain. Other drugs either boost
        the levels of these chemicals or help prevent their degradation or destruction.
